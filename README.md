# Personal Dashboard

My dashboard is inspired by the Chrome Momentum dashboard! This is the first project 
I have done where I used multiple APIs to complete different tasks. I implemented the 
following APIs to this personal dashboard:

-OpenWeatherMap to provide weather info for
 any users current area
-Coingecko Api to provide current market data on Bitcoin
-Unsplash to generate a random image each time dashboard comes up on users screen
-Lastly, Advice Slip to generate random advice on the click of a button

Below is a screenshot of what this chrome extension looks like:
