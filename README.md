# Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

Inspired by the user-friendly design of the Chrome Momentum dashboard, I embarked on a project to create a personalized 
dashboard chrome extension that seamlessly integrates multiple APIs to enhance the user experience. This dynamic extension
transforms the user's new tab page into a multifunctional hub, catering to a variety of needs.

## Key API Integrations:

### OpenWeatherMap:
Harnessing the power of OpenWeatherMap API, the dashboard delivers real-time weather information based on the user's current
location. Users can effortlessly stay informed about the weather conditions, ensuring they are prepared for the day ahead.

### Coingecko API:
For crypto enthusiasts, the extension taps into the Coingecko API to provide up-to-the-minute market data on Bitcoin. This
feature empowers users to track the cryptocurrency market trends directly from their new tab, adding a financial dimension to
their browsing experience.

### Unsplash:
Elevating the aesthetics of the dashboard, I integrated the Unsplash API to dynamically generate a visually appealing, high-quality
image each time the new tab is opened. This not only enhances the user interface but also adds a touch of creativity to the browsing
environment.

### Advice Slip:
To inject a dose of inspiration, the dashboard includes the Advice Slip API. With a simple click of a button, users can access random
pieces of advice, providing a quick and uplifting break during their online sessions.

This chrome extension is a testament to the convergence of functionality and aesthetics. Users can customize their browsing experience,
staying informed about the weather, market trends, and even receiving a bit of adviceâ€”all within the convenience of their new tab.
